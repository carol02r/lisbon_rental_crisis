# MY472-AT24 Final Project: Mapping Lisbonâ€™s Rental Crisis

This repository contains data, documentation, and analyses for my MY472 project, which investigates Lisbon's rental market crisis. 

The project combines rental property data retireved from [Idealista](https://www.idealista.pt) with socioeconomic indicators from Portugal's National Statistics Institute ([INE](https://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpgid=ine_main&xpid=INE)) and geographic data on municipality boundaries and key amenities. The datasets created enable geographical analysis, visualizations, and predictive modeling to support policy-makers in tackling Lisbon's rental crisis. Some use cases are included to demonstrate the analysis process and findings.
